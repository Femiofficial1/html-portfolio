<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO DAMILOLA</h1>
<H2>This are my top 3 movies of all time</H2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>I love gladiator because its just poetic. From being great and having almost everything to having nothing. <br />
From a general to a slave out to seek revenge. <br />
 I loved it alot<br />
</p>
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>i loved the green mile because it just was a very emotional movie. i couldn't go through it without crying <br />
I feel like a lot of people find themselves in this situation. In the process of doing good you are misconstrued for doing bad and i don't really know how to feel about that</p>
<h3>300 Spartans</h3>
<p> well i love this because it was super dramatic i guess</p>
